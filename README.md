# music-valence

My interest in learning Python led me to develop a machine learning project where I created a neural net to detect valences of unknown .mp3s using the Keras ML Library. This is the first step in creating a homemade music taste generator.

Work to still be completed: <br/>
Add a more detailed README <br/>
Visaulize data <br/>
Fix bugs when forming generators and shaping data, Adjust model <br/>
Optimize!
